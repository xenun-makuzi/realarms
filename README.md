# Liberty Arms website

Static site (HTML, CSS, vanilla JS ES modules) with a Supabase backend: Auth, Postgres with RLS, and Storage. No build step.

**Status:** written but not yet run against a live Supabase project. Follow the checks in step 7 before relying on it.

## 1. Requirements
A Supabase account, any static file server (`npx serve .` or `python3 -m http.server`; ES modules do not work from `file://`), and optionally the [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli) and Git.

## 2. Get the project
Unzip it, `cd liberty-arms`, `git init`, then serve the folder and open `http://localhost:3000` (or your server's port).

## 3. Create a Supabase project
Create a project at supabase.com. Leave **Allow new users to sign up** on and keep email confirmation on: customers register on the site, and admin rights come only from the `user_roles` table.

## 4. Configure
Put the project URL and the **publishable** key (Project Settings > API) in `assets/js/config.js`. Never use a service-role/secret key in this project. If config is missing the site shows a setup notice and built-in content.

## 5. Run migrations
CLI: `supabase link --project-ref <ref>` then `supabase db push`. Or paste each file in `supabase/migrations/` into the SQL editor, in order. Optionally run `supabase/seed.sql`.

## 6. Create the first administrator
1. Dashboard > Authentication > Users > **Add user** (set a strong password, auto-confirm).
2. In the SQL editor (not through the API) run:
```sql
insert into public.user_roles (user_id, role)
select id, 'admin' from auth.users where email = 'you@example.com';
```
There is no default admin and no API path to grant roles. Sign in at `/admin/login.html`.

## 7. Verify RLS
```sql
begin; set local role anon;
select count(*) from public.contact_messages;          -- expect: permission denied
select * from public.compliance_records;               -- expect: permission denied
select count(*) from public.public_compliance_records; -- allowed (verified, unexpired only)
select count(*) from public.faqs;                      -- published rows only
rollback;
```
Repeat as a non-admin signed-in user (they should see no enquiries, audit rows or compliance rows) and as an admin (full access). Submit the contact form 4 times quickly: the 4th should be refused.

## 8. Test the site
Public: each page loads with an empty database; publish an FAQ, announcement and a verified compliance record (with a public summary) and confirm they appear; draft/pending ones must not. Admin: sign in/out, edit each section, delete with confirmation, open an enquiry and change its status.

Useful `site_settings` keys: `business_name`, `contact_email`, `contact_phone`, `address`, `business_hours`, `footer_text`. Page content (Pages section) accepts plain text; blank lines make paragraphs. HTML is escaped.

## 9. Deploy
Upload the folder to any static host (Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, GitHub Pages, Vercel). `/admin/` is protected by Auth plus RLS, not by hiding the URL.

## 10. Production domain
Point your domain at the host, then set Supabase **Authentication > URL Configuration** to that site URL. Replace `www.example.com` in `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml`.

## 11. Backups and documents
Enable Supabase backups for your plan or run `supabase db dump`. Storage files are not included in database dumps; download them separately. `private-documents` is a private bucket for admins only; share files with short-lived signed URLs (for example 60 seconds), never public links. Names should be random (`crypto.randomUUID()`).

## 12. Common problems
- **Setup notice shown:** `config.js` still has placeholders.
- **Blank page / import errors:** serve over http, not `file://`.
- **"Not authorised" at sign-in:** the user has no row in `user_roles`.
- **Empty lists although data exists:** status is not `published`, `published_at` is in the future, or a compliance record is not `verified` with a public summary.
- **"Too many submissions":** the per-address limit (3 per 10 minutes) triggered.

## Not included / needs your input
- Upload UI for private compliance documents (the compliance form takes a storage path as text) and content preview.
- A payment provider (see the payments notes above), customer self-service cancellation, and order emails. Staff contact customers.
- CAPTCHA: a honeypot and the database rate limit are in place; stronger protection (for example Cloudflare Turnstile verified in an Edge Function) needs server-side code.
- Real company facts, credentials, and jurisdiction-specific safety links. None are invented.
- Privacy and Terms are drafts requiring legal review.
- `public_compliance_records` is a view that runs with owner rights by design; Supabase's linter may flag it.

## Store (shop, categories, product pages)
- Run both migrations (`..._initial_schema.sql`, then `..._store.sql`). The second creates `categories`, `products` and `reservations` with RLS and six starter categories.
- Optional: run `supabase/seed_demo.sql` to preview the shop with clearly labelled demo products. Delete them in Admin > Products before launch.
- Admin > Categories and Products: add items, upload images (public `public-media` bucket, random file names), tick Featured, and set status to Published to show them. Specs are one `Label: value` per line.
- Visitors reserve or enquire from a product page; nothing is paid online. Requests appear in Admin > Reservations and cannot be read by visitors.
- Currency is the `currency_code` setting (default USD).
- Verify as anon: `select count(*) from public.reservations;` must be permission denied, and draft products must not appear in the shop.

## Accounts, cart, orders and payments
- Run all three migrations in order. Then open Admin > Delivery methods: Store pickup is published; set fees and publish the other methods you offer.
- Customers register on `account.html`. Admin rights come only from `public.user_roles`, which cannot be changed through the API.
- The cart lives in the visitor's browser as a convenience only. At checkout the `place_order` database function re-reads prices and stock, enforces each product's fulfilment rule (`licensed_transfer` by default, `ship`, or `pickup_only`) and rate-limits orders. Browser prices are never trusted.
- Orders start as "pending review". Review eligibility in Admin > Orders and set the status to Approved. Then collect payment: on collection, bank transfer (text from the `payment_instructions` setting) or a payment link you email. Set Paid and add tracking when done.
- No payment provider is built in, and many processors do not allow firearms sales, so confirm yours does. To mark orders paid automatically, deploy `supabase/functions/payment-webhook` (`supabase functions deploy payment-webhook --no-verify-jwt`, then `supabase secrets set PAYMENT_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<long random value>`). It accepts a POST `{order_id, reference, amount}` with header `x-signature` set to the hex HMAC-SHA256 of the raw body, and only marks an approved order paid when the amount equals the order total. The secret and service-role key stay on the server.
- Extra product images: Admin > Products > edit a product > Gallery images. Admin lists have search, a status filter and 15-per-page pagination.
- Verify: as anon `select count(*) from public.orders;` must be permission denied; a signed-in customer sees only their own orders; `place_order` must refuse out-of-stock items and a `ship` method for a `licensed_transfer` product.

## v2 update: checkout, payments and launch checklist
- `cart.html` and `checkout.html` were static mockups (fake products, a placeholder Bitcoin address, no backend). They now run the real cart and `place_order()` from `assets/js/commerce.js` and are responsive. The SQL is unchanged.
- **Payment methods** live in `assets/js/payments.js`. The database only accepts `pay_on_collection`, `bank_transfer` and `payment_link`, so each method maps to one of them and the exact choice is written as the first line of the order notes ("Payment preference: ..."). After placing an order the customer sees a payment box and a Contact support button that opens the Tawk.to chat (address set in `assets/js/chat.js`) to get payment details. Orders still appear as pending review in Admin.
  - On by default: ACH bank transfer, wire, cryptocurrency (BTC, ETH, LTC) and pay on collection.
  - Built but off: Zelle, Chime, PayPal, Apple Pay. PayPal, Apple Pay and Zelle prohibit firearms and ammunition in their own terms (check Chime directly). To turn any on, add a setting in Admin > Settings: `payment_methods_enabled` = `bank,wire,crypto,in_person,zelle` (ids as listed in `payments.js`).
  - Details customers see on their order page (optional, otherwise support sends them in chat): add settings named `payment_instructions_bank`, `payment_instructions_wire`, `payment_instructions_crypto` and so on. Settings are publicly readable, so do not publish full bank account numbers there; send those by email.
- `orders.internal_notes` can be read through the API by the customer who owns the order (RLS works per row), so keep sensitive staff notes elsewhere.
- Launch checklist: license or replace the hero photo (the old `back.jpg` was an Adobe Stock watermarked preview and has been removed); confirm the contact details on About and Contact; replace `www.example.com` in `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml`; have a lawyer review Terms and Privacy; confirm the Tawk.to chat property belongs to the business; publish only credentials you can document (the ATF, NRA and BBB badges, "ship to all states", "discreet shipping" and "anonymous" wording were unverifiable and have been removed).
- This has not been run against a live Supabase project yet: do the checks in sections 7 and 8 first.
- **Auth emails (do this before launch):** Supabase's built-in email service is capped at a few emails per hour and only sends to your own team's addresses, so customer sign-ups and password resets will fail with HTTP 429 or "Email address not authorized". In the Supabase dashboard set up your own SMTP (Authentication > SMTP Settings), then raise the limit under Authentication > Rate Limits. Also add your site URL (and `http://127.0.0.1:5500/**` for local testing) under Authentication > URL Configuration, or confirmation and reset links will not return to the site. For local tests only, you can turn off "Confirm email" under Authentication > Providers > Email.
- Customers can now reset a forgotten password from the account page ("Forgot your password?").
- **Fastest way to test accounts without email:** in Supabase go to Authentication > Users > Add user > Create new user, enter an email and password and tick "Auto Confirm User". That account can sign in straight away and uses no email quota. (The browser console still prints a red line for any failed request, such as a 429 or 400; that is normal.)
- **Offering shipping:** (1) in Admin > Delivery methods set a fee on "Standard shipping" and publish it; (2) in Admin > Products set `fulfilment` to `ship` on each item that may lawfully be shipped to the customer. Shipping appears at checkout only when every item in the cart is `ship`; the database enforces this too. Firearms generally have to go through a licensed dealer (rules vary by state and carrier), so confirm with your compliance advisor before marking any `ship`.
- **Delivery methods setup:** run `setup/delivery-methods.sql` once in the Supabase SQL Editor. It publishes Store pickup and Standard shipping (edit the fee at the top), hides dealer transfer and lets default products ship. It is safe to re-run.
